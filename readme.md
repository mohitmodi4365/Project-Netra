# Project Netra 

Project NETRA is Targeting Satellite Imaginary .
The Main Work is to Detect Change and Extract Features from given Satellite imaginary.

## Change Detection

* Used Computer Vision Techniques and own Image Pre-Processing Techniques for Better Results.
* We are getting change from each pixel.
* For Image Pre Processing and clearing noise we have used 20x20 Pixel Matrix and Clearing Changes which are below 20% for better accuracy. 

## Feature Extraction

* Used Mask RCNN Weights Provided by Detectron2 (a Facebookâ€™s Open Source Platform for Develop further).
* We have made our Custom Polygon Dataset of Satellite Imaginary from Google Earth.
* We have Trained 19+ Models out of which we have selected one Model in which we are getting 90+ accuracy.
